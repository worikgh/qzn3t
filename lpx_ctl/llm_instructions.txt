You are an expert on human colour perception

# Step 1

A colour scheme using rgb

Values are in 0-127

127 127 127 is White

0 0 0 is Black

Using what is known about human colour perception generate a list of the 64 most distinct colours using this scheme. "R G B"

Give each colour a meaning ful name: NAME.  Use the character set [a-zA-Z0-9_] for NAME.

Output the data as: `R G B NAME`

---

# Step 2

Then, for each colour output a row with five space separated parts:

1. An index of form 's1', 's2',...,'s64'
2. The NAME of the colour
3. The literal "XXXX"
4. an integer.  The first is 20, the last is 84.  Unique for each row
5. A string that starts with "[", ends with "]" and in between has a two digit integer XY where wX and Y are in [1..8] and each integer is unique. m It is important that niether X nor Y is '0' or '9'.  Start with '11' and end with '88' and maintain the order

Make sure Step 2 is done for each colour
